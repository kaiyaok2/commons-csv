/**
 * Tests https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CSV-213
 * <p>
 * This is normal behavior with the current architecture: The iterator() API presents an object that is backed by data
 * in the CSVParser as the parser is streaming over the file. The CSVParser is like a forward-only stream. When you
 * create a new Iterator you are only created a new view on the same position in the parser's stream. For the behavior
 * you want, you need to open a new CSVParser.
